= Adding Groups

Create a group called *viewers* using the `+groupadd+` command. You will
use the `+-g+` option to specify a group ID (GID), in this case 10000:

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
groupadd -g 10000 viewers
----

This command has no expected output.

NOTE: Every time a new user is created, there is a primary group that
is automatically generated for the user. When creating your own group,
it is best practice to specify a GID that leaves room for primary groups
to be be generated with the same ID as the user account. New user IDs
are typically generated ascending from 1000. Selecting a GID of 10000 in
this example ensures that new user accounts will have ample space to
generate their own primary group IDs that are equivalent to their user
ID.

Search for the group name in the `+/etc/group+` file to confirm this was
successful:

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
grep -w viewers /etc/group
----

.Output
[source,bash]
----
viewers:x:10000:
----

This file shows the group name, the GID, and which users belong to the
group. In this case, *viewers* does not yet have any users associated
with it, but you can see the custom GID of 10000 was successfully set.
Now you will see how to add users to this group.

== Adding users to a group

Now that you have created this group, add the *guest* user from the
previous step to the *viewers* group using `+usermod+`. You will use the
secondary group option (`+-G+`) in conjunction with the append option
(`+-a+`) to add *viewers* without overwriting any existing groups
associated with *guest*.

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
usermod -aG viewers guest
----

This command has no expected output.

The `+groups+` command is useful for validating this change, because it
lists all groups associated with a user:

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
groups guest
----

.Output
[source,bash]
----
guest : guest viewers
----

The *viewers* group has been added alongside the accountâ€™s primary group
(*guest*).

NOTE: Using the secondary group option (`+-G+`) adds *viewers* as a
_secondary group_ for the *guest* user. Users can have any number of
secondary groups. If you instead wanted to replace the primary group for
*guest*, use `+-g+` when calling `+groupadd+`. You cannot use `+-a+` to
append a primary group, as users can only have one primary group.
