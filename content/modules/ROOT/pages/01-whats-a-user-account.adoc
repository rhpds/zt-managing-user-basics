= Creating user accounts with useradd

Add a new account called *guest* using the `+useradd+` command:

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
useradd guest
----

This command has no expected output.

Confirm the account creation by examining the *passwd* file.

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
grep -w guest /etc/passwd
----

.Output
[source,bash]
----
guest:x:1889:1889::/home/guest:/bin/bash
----

NOTE: The UserID and GroupID *"1889"* will vary between systems

Next, a password needs to be added to the user account to enable login.
