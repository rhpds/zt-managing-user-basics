= Removing a user from a group

If you want to remove a user from a group without deleting the group,
run the following command:

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
gpasswd -d guest viewers
----

.Output
[source,bash]
----
Removing user guest from group viewers
----

NOTE: This change will not take effect until the user logs in again.

== Deleting a group

If instead you want to delete the group all together, run the
`+groupdel+` command as root.

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
groupdel viewers
----

This command has no expected output.

If you are trying to remove the primary group of a user, you must remove
that user first.

Attempting to add a user to this group will print an error message
showing that it now does not exist.

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
usermod -aG viewers guest
----

.Output
[source,bash]
----
usermod: group 'viewers' does not exist
----
